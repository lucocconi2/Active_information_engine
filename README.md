# Information engine operating on a single active particle 

Source codes for the paper "On the efficiency of an autonomous, dynamic information engine operating on a single active particle" by Luca Cocconi and Letian Chen (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08496.pdf). The (Python) code, in the form of a Jupyter notebook, gives further details on the numerical methods used to evaluate some of the implicit analytical expression given in the main text and to generate the associated figures.

The repository contains some additional data from Ref.[24], within the folder "work_data_and_plotter". It also contains some numpy arrays that are generated for the sake of convenience as output at intermediate stages of the numerical evaluation.
